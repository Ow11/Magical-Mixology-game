# Magical Mixology game

This is my semestral project for TWS 2022/2023:
an SPA with a game written on vanilla JS.

For image generation was used stable diffusion.
For its prompts, text generation and even for selecting colors and helping with the design OpenAI's ChatGPT was used.

As a part of repository I provide a simple dev server on flask.
To run it you must have flask installed, then just run `python flask_server.py`.
